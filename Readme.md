# Scorebini

Scorebini is a scoreboard tracker which can be docked in OBS for users with only a single monitor.


## How to use

The start page of the app is the settings page. Enter your challonge api key (middle click the link next to the settings to go to the developer api page) and set the output directory where you want to write the individual .txt files.

Change to the scoreboard screen and load a bracket by entering the whole challonge url and click the "Pull" button to show the player name inputs. Update the players and score when required. Clicking the "Update Scoreboard" button will write everything to separate .txt files in the "Output Directory" option from the settings page.

Use the separate .txt files as inputs for OBS text elements.

The dock url in OBS will be http://localhost:8289
